A beautifully crafted theme/template for JSDoc 3. This theme/template looks and feels like a premium theme/template. This is a fully mobile responsive theme and also fully customizable theme (for more look below in <a href="#features">feature section</a>).<br>

I give extra care on every part of this theme/template, like instead of using a simple search mechanism I have used one of the most advance search technology <a href="https://fusejs.io/">Fuse.js</a>.<br>

Feel free to raise <a href="https://github.com/ankitskvmdam/clean-jsdoc-theme/issues">issues</a>,

## Install

> Note you must have `npm` installed on your machine.

On your command line type

```bash
npm install clean-jsdoc-theme
```

## Usage

Clone repository to your designated jsdoc template directory, then

```bash
jsdoc entry-file.js -t path/to/clean-jsdoc-theme
```

## Node.js Dependency

In your projects package.json file add a generate script

```json
"script": {
  "generate-docs": "node_modules/.bin/jsdoc --configure .jsdoc.json --verbose"
}
```

In your `jsdoc.json` file, add a template option.

```json
"opts": {
  "template": "node_modules/clean-jsdoc-theme"
}
```

## Example JSDoc Config

```json
{
    "source": {
        "include": ["lib", "package.json", "README.md"],
        "includePattern": ".js$",
        "excludePattern": "(node_modules/|docs)"
    },

    "plugins": ["plugins/markdown"],

    "opts": {
        "encoding": "utf8",
        "readme": "./README.md",
        "destination": "docs/",
        "recurse": true,
        "verbose": true,
        "template": "./node_modules/clean-jsdoc-theme"
    }
}
```

## Features

I believe in giving freedom to the developer, that's why I have given many options to
the developer to customize this theme according to their needs.
You can pass an object called `theme_opts` under `opts` for more options like:

```json5
"opts":{
  /*
    Default options
  */
  "theme_opts":{
    // Set theme. Default is light
    "theme": "dark",
    /*
      Instead of only string you can pass html element like
      <img src="src to your img relative to the output path" class="my-custom-class"/>
      Path must be relative to the output file (relative to generated html files.) you
      can use the absolute path.
      Note: If you use html the default overwrite. Also for custom class you have to create
      a class using create_style.This is shown below.
    */
    "title": "clean-jsdoc-theme",

   "filter": false, /*  The default value is true. This will turn the color of image white.
      If you did not want any
      filter set it to false.
   */

  // Adding additional menu.
  "menu": [
    {
      "title": "Website", //You have to give title otherwise you get error.
      "link": "https://ankdev.me/clean-jsdoc-theme/index.html", // You have to give link otherwise you get error.
      // Below properties are optional.
      "target": "_blank",
      "class": "some-class",
      "id": "some-id"
    },
    {
      "title": "Github",
      "link": "https://github.com/ankitskvmdam/clean-jsdoc-theme/",
      "target": "_blank",
      "class": "some-class",
      "id": "some-id"
    }
  ],

  // You can pass meta options also
  "meta": [
      "<meta name=\"author\" content=\"Ankit Kumar\">",
      "<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Best Clean and minimal JSDoc 3 Template / Theme\">"
    ],

  "search": false, //This option is for either showing or hiding the search. By default it is true.

  // You can create custom style which will overwrite the exisiting class property.
  "create_style": "nav{background: yellow}", // This will change the background color of sidebar.
  //You can add path of your style file. Note it must be relative to your output file. (relative to generated html files.)
  "add_style_path": ["../custom.css"], // Pass array of path or url

  // You can add custom script to html
  "add_scripts": "function foo(){console.log('foo')}",

  // You can add path of your script file. Note it must be relative to your output file. (relative to generated html files.)
  "add_script_path": ["../custom.js"], // Pass array of path or url

  "footer": "This is footer",   // Here again you can pass html element
  }
}
```
